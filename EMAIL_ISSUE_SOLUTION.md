# Email Issue Solution

## Problem
After form submission, neither the user nor admin receives emails.

## Root Cause
The application requires a backend email server to be running, but it's not currently active. The frontend is configured to send emails to `http://localhost:3001/api/send-email`, but there's no server listening on port 3001.

## Solution

### 1. Start the Email Server
The project includes a development email server (`dev-server.js`) that needs to be running alongside the frontend.

**Option A: Run manually**
```bash
node dev-server.js
```

**Option B: Use npm script**
```bash
npm run dev:email
```

**Option C: Run both frontend and email server together**
```bash
npm run dev:full
```

### 2. Configuration Files Updated

#### .env file
Updated with proper email configuration:
```env
# Email API endpoint
VITE_EMAIL_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3001/api/send-email

# SMTP Configuration (test mode)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=test@example.com
SMTP_PASS=test_app_password

# Email settings
ADMIN_EMAIL=info@mantragroup.ca
COMPANY_NAME=Mantra Group
FROM_NAME=Website Contact

# Test mode enabled for development
EMAIL_TEST_MODE=true
```

#### package.json
Added new scripts:
- `dev:email` - Runs only the email server
- `dev:full` - Runs both frontend and email server

### 3. How It Works

1. **Frontend Forms**: Contact, quote, and newsletter forms send data to the email service
2. **Email Service**: `emailServiceServerless.js` makes HTTP requests to the backend API
3. **Backend API**: `dev-server.js` runs an Express server that handles email sending
4. **Email Handler**: `api/send-email.js` processes email requests using Nodemailer

### 4. Test Mode
The email server is configured in test mode (`EMAIL_TEST_MODE=true`), which means:
- No actual emails are sent
- Email content is logged to the console
- All email operations return success
- Perfect for development and testing

### 5. Production Setup
For production, you would:
1. Set `EMAIL_TEST_MODE=false`
2. Configure real SMTP credentials
3. Deploy the email API to a serverless platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
4. Update `VITE_EMAIL_API_ENDPOINT` to point to the production API

### 6. Verification
To test if the email system is working:
1. Start the email server: `npm run dev:email`
2. Start the frontend: `npm run dev`
3. Submit a form on the website
4. Check the email server console for logged email content
5. Verify success/error messages appear in the frontend

## Current Status
✅ Email server code is ready
✅ Configuration files are updated
✅ Frontend is properly configured
⚠️ Email server needs to be started manually

## Next Steps
1. Start the email server using one of the methods above
2. Test form submissions
3. Verify email content appears in server logs
4. For production: configure real SMTP credentials
